I analyzed the distribution of festivals and fairs in the Lombardy region using PostgreSQL, MySQL, and PostGIS.

Subsequently, using Overpass-Turbo, I visualized the bus stops in the Lombardy region, and I plotted everything through QGIS. 

By using Neo4J, I was able to identify connections that were not clear before.

Finally, using PowerBI, I visualized the geolocation of the fairs in the Lombardy region.
